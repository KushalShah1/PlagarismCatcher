Silence filled the office. Quitting time had passed many minutes ago, but paperwork had consumed me. Everytime I walked into this office, I regret taking this job. Didn’t pay much, was way too tiring, and worst of all, it was against Castro. Let me go back and explain how I got screwed over working here. My friend’s father had been a high ranking official in the Cuban government for a long time and he said he knew someone that was looking for an intern to file paper. Avidly looking for pocket money, I stupidly agreed. Little did I know I signed up to work for Aníbal Escalante. He was a member of the Populist party and had been notorious for being exiled to Prague 6 years ago. He was a pro-Soviet communist which did not sit well with Castro. Within the last 8 or so years Castro has become opposed to the Soviets. After the whole missile crisis, Castro got fed up with being a USSR puppet. Pro-Soviets politicians in Havana started to disappear and Escalante was the first major politician to get exiled. A few years ago he came back to Havana and everyone knew that scumbag was back to his anti-Castro meddlings. Rumors spread around that he was planning a coup. Others said he was trying to get the USSR to invade Cuba. Long story short, I got stuck working for him and that how I ended up in a whole load of trouble. Last month, 2 hours after the office closed, I was still doing some last minute paperwork. As I was packing up, a white man in a trench coat walked into Escalante's office. I left without thinking much of anything, but as I was walking away another man walked into the office building. This time a Cuban man. Nothing happened for a few days, work as usual, until one day half way through a fax the doors flung open and a bag was placed over my head. Everything went black and I was dragged out of the office. Screams of elderly men rained supreme over all other noise and we were pushed into a car. As we rushed through city, we were all tossing and banging into each other in the trunk. The next thing I remember is when the bag was taken off my head and a blinding light illuminated my eyes. Surrounding me was all my coworkers and surprisingly, Escalante. Encompassing us was a cage built of rusted metal bars. Days went by without any information on my detainment, but one day a large man walked in with the guards. I recognized him as one of Castro’s top right hand henchman. He told us that we were all jailed for conspiring to overthrow the government and divulging government secrets. Obviously I had done nothing wrong and now more than ever I was angry. We all demanded answers from Escalante, and he revealed that he had a meeting with a KGB agent after hours and randomly a government inspector barged in and witness the exchange. I was furious, I should have known to quit and never have gotten involved in politics during the revolution. Castro had started party purges and I was a victim of his evil. Luckily for me and some of my coworkers, we were let out within a few days because it was blatantly obvious all we did was file paperwork. Others were not so lucky. Some of the lesser known men that knew of Escalante's meddlings were exiled. I still do not know where they are. If it was up to me Escalante should have been sent away to the Soviet Union, but he had become too high profile to just vanish. Escalante's final sentence is set to be revealed next week. Hopefully he will get life, because he was this close to ruining mine.
