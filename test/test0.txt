A loud copper bell roared in the distance. Light was still far from the horizon, but for the young men in Tenochtitlan the day had begun. Hustling around the training camp, men scrambled to rise out of bed and get dressed, all except one. Young Acalan had just started his training in the Telpochcalli of Tenochtitlan. Ever since he was born every decision he made had been choreographed. The day of his birth saw the gathering of many of the top leaders in Tenochtitlan. He had been born on matlactli cuauhtli, and for men born on this day they were destined to be great warriors. As he grew, his parents ingrained the warriors will into Acalan. Up until a few weeks ago, Acalan had been under his parents care, but now he was of age where all the warriors went to the Telpochcalli for training. Spears stabbing and tribe conquering is what Acalan was expecting to learn. Foreign humans were spotted on the shore just a few weeks ago and Acalan thought he was going to prepare to fight them. Everyone around Tenochtitlan was fascinated with the weird pale creatures appearing on the coast. A quiet buzz encapsulated the city, people were thinking that the gods had arrived. But reality struck very soon into his training. Instead of stabbing spears, he was stabbing bricks into broken walls. Instead of conquesting tribes he was conquesting clogged aqueducts and beating the life out of the fallen leaves. Today was an especially bad day for Acalan. Last night he had spent the entire day sweeping and cleaning the house, only going to sleep well into the night. While the other boys scrambled out of bed to fulfil their day's chores, Acalan slumped out of his cot to grudgingly pick up his broom painted to resemble a spear. Acalan has been training since birth and he took these brooms as an insult to him. The leaders said it was to get the new warriors comfortable with spears, but Acalan felt that is was a mockery. The Telpochtlato was responsible for handing out the daily chores, and today he gave the young men something especially exciting. They were to repair the crisscrossing waterways of the central city. Acalan was elated as this was probably the most interesting task he would have in a long time. The cruised the canals and patched holes in the chinampas with straw. At the Telpochcalli all entertainment was banned, since it encouraged discipline. All he could do was chores and participate in the nightly rituals. While the rituals were meant to serve as their nightly entertainment, dancing and singing weren’t of particular interest to Acalan. He had gotten bored of all the same rituals night after night. He had to bathe with all the other men and paint his body for rituals he had no care to be part of. Also he had not make many friends at the camp. Most of the other men were far less mature and Acalan wondered many times why the destined warrior was trained in the same camp. Luckily he found relief from all the chaos and boredom of the training camp, when he went home for dinner. Once a day he was allowed to eat and he was only allowed to eat at his home. Two small maize cakes a day was all he was allotted to eat as it was sanctioned by the Telpochcalli that he learn how to meal ration. This didn’t bother Acalan that much since all his life he had been given such little food by his parents to prepare him to fulfil his destiny. He found great joy of eating not because of the food but because he got to see his parents. Finally after leaving his home and all the nightly events Acalan headed back to his small cot and prepared for another day of backbreaking labor. As he closed his eyes, he dreamt of finally passing this obedience training and move into warfare training. But as he fell into a slumber, the thought of foreigners lingered in the back of his head. His destiny was set at birth to be the strongest warrior, and he knew he would have to fulfill that destiny soon.
