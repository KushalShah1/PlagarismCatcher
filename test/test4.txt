Panama today is a thriving country bridging North and South America. It stands out among its neighbors as a stable and relatively wealthy. Panama’s GDP per capita is over 2 times greater than its southern neighbor, Colombia. While the country serves as a major traffic zone for illegal substances, Panama, unlike the majority of the region, has not politically or economically been destroyed from the drug trade. The question is how has Panama continued to thrive and emerge as one of the stablest countries in Latin America. The answers stem back to the creation of the countries lifeblood, the Panama Canal. At the time of its construction, the canal was deemed to be a marvel of human engineering. Today it still stands as one of the greatest feats in history. With the Panamanian government finishing an operation to expand the canal in 2016, the consequences of this action are yet unknown. In order to predict the environmental, social, economic, and political changes that are going to occur after the canal’s expansion, we must look into the past and examine how the construction of the Panama Canal has affected modern-day Panama.
The history of Panama stems back 4 million years ago as the sliver of land rose out of the ocean. By 12,000 BCE humans had begun living there and using the land as a major transit point into South America. After Columbus discovered the America’s, a Spanish man named Rodrigo Galvan de las Bastides sailed to the Americas. He landed on islands just north of Panama, but due to his ships bad state, he went back to Spain. Columbus on his 4th trip to the Americas landed on the isthmus in 1502 (Harding, 2006). Columbus’s brother and 80 other men set up the first colony in Panama call Santa Maria de Belen. After the natives showed Columbus gold, he reported back to the Spanish monarchs about the abundance of precious metal in the land. The monarchs called for the settlement of Panama. In 1510 the Spanish established Santa Maria de La Antigua del Darien. The governor of the settlement, Vasco Nuñez de Balboa, heard from the locals that there is lots of gold by the “South Sea”. Leading a group of men, they headed south. In 1513, they became the first Europeans to see the Pacific Ocean (Harding, 2006). Balboa then reported back to the Monarchs that he had found another ocean. By 1530, multiple surveys of the land had been done to verify if there was any connection between the two oceans. The colonizers had found none, so King Charles V ordered Balboa to find a route to the Pacific Ocean following the Chagres River (Parker, 2014). King Charles V had created the first conception of a Panama Canal. Sources conflict on whether Balboa reported the conditions to be too hostile to build a canal or King Charles wanted to make sure the Inca Empire did not have an easy way to take Panama. Nevertheless, the construction of the canal did not start. The idea of the canal did not resurge until the late 1600s when the Scottish parliament passed an act encouraging settlements in the New World. A man named William Patterson had previously been to Panama on a mission trip. On the trip, he conjured an idea to establish ports on both sides of Panama and then set up a temporary road between the two ports. Eventually, he thought, that the road could be turned into a waterway. After seeing the Scottish parliament wanted to encourage settlements he proposed his idea to the parliament. The parliament was swayed and William raised £400,000 for the plan. The Scottish created the “Company of Scotland trading to Africa and the Indies” (Parker, 2004). Five ships left the port in Edinburgh heading for Panama. By the time they landed in Panama, protests were raging in London. English merchants protested due to a fear of competition and the Spanish protested since they claimed the land. The English, therefore, bared all trade with the Scottish settlement. This was a major blow to the Scottish settlement and they were forced to abandon the site due to a lack of supplies. The last Scottish were kicked out by Spanish troops in 1700 (Parker, 2014). Due to the significant amount of capital wasted by this endeavor, the Scottish were forced to merge into Great Britain. 
Spanish rule in Latin America was sustained until the 1820s. Up until the 19th century the Spanish had been appointing peninsulares (Spaniards born in Spain) to official positions, while the native populations were discriminated against. The Spanish also enacted a restriction on trade with other countries (Harding, 2006). This lead to a tense climate in Latin America and all that was needed for a revolution was a spark. When Napoleon invaded Spain, many of the New World countries declared independence. But as revolutions raged in Mexico and South America, Panama remained loyal to the monarchy. As the Spanish lost territory in the Americas, they moved the royal post to Panama where it remained until 1821. That year the viceroy of Nueva Granada died. Combined with the citizens being abused and trade suffering due to the wars, Panama declared independence on November 28, 1821, with minimal fighting. The elite merchants of Panama decided to join Bolivar’s Gran Republic of Colombia (Harding, 2006). Panama has always been an area focused on trade. With their economic policy and trade policy being decided in Bogota, Panama had growing nationalistic sentiments. When Bolivar died, the Republic broke up and Panama became a province of Colombia. The leaders in Colombia let Panama have a large amount of autonomy. Even though this meant Panama was allowed to create liberal trade laws, it also meant that Panamanians were neglected by Bogota. Many attempted for independence were made and they were all thwarted. Panama kept on growing in its influence due to the prospects of a canal across the isthmus. Lured by the trade route, the British, in 1848, stole the town of San Juan del Norte in Nicaragua. The British continued to pester the Colombian government about possible canal routes and they eventually hinted at a possible seizure of Bocas del Toro, a city in Panama (Harding, 2006) The United States took advantage of Colombian fear and negotiated the Bidlack-Mallarino treaty. This granted the US transit rights across Panama and assured Colombia that the United States would protect Panama from any foreign invasion. This treaty stopped all British hope in establishing a canal, which infuriated the British government. To settle the tension between the US and Great Britain the Clayton-Bulwer treaty was created (Parker, 2014). This stipulated that all canal projects in Panama would be a joint effort by both British and Americans. US foreign politics with Panama after the treaty actually severely ignored the treaty’s content. Most British protests were ignored. This helped solidify US economic interest in Panama.
Since the Bidlack-Mallarino treaty granted the US transit rights across the isthmus, many people saw the strip of land as a transit zone for mail. As the US expanded west, the need for fast mail transit was needed. William H. Aspinwall was contracted to create a faster mail service. Aspinwall wanted to build a railroad across Panama to link the oceans closer. They negotiated a contract with the Colombian government and they were granted free land to build the railroad. Native Panamanians did not want to build the railroad due to the grueling conditions, so Aspinwall had to import labor from, the West Indies, China, Africa, Great Britain, and Germany (Parker, 2014) Due to the immigration of these workers the ethnic makeup of Panama began to diversify. As Panama saw increased traffic of people coming to the country the need for law enforcement increased. The Colombian government could not supply the necessary quantity of police, so Aspinwall brought in US law enforcement. This even father consolidated the US presence in Panama. The railroad was completed in 1855 and proved incredibly lucrative. This was the first proper infrastructure project directly connecting the two oceans. While the Americans reaped the benefits of the railroad, average Panamanians were left unemployed and there were anti-American sentiments growing as the US gained more and more control of the region (Tenner, 2005). Coupled with the unjust spread of wealth in Panama, the Americans brought their racist values and were rude to Panamanians. Multiple conflicts between Panamanians and the Americans caused thirteen separate US military interventions in Panama. 
As time went on Americans saw the need for a canal. In 1870 the US proposed to Colombia a plan for joint ownership of a canal. After Colombia rejected the proposal due to extremely low-profit sharing, the US started investing in a canal through Nicaragua along with the British. The French saw an opportunity to go into Panama and build the canal. Ferdinand de Lesseps, the builder of the Suez Canal, led the movement to fund the project. After his triumphant success in Egypt, his sphere of influence allowed him to get funding without much contest. Construction started in 1880, personally headed by de Lesseps (Tenner, 2005). By 1884, it was evident that de Lesseps underestimated costs drastically. Also, rampant amounts of malaria and yellow fever cases led to the death of 20,000 people. The French attempt of building the canal was a complete failure. The United States then bought the French company and demanded the Colombian government allow the US to build the canal. Bogota still resisted so the US funded the separatist movement in Panama. On November 3, 1903, the separatists declared independence. For compensation for funding the independence movement, the new Panamanian government signed the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty. This gave the US permanent ownership of the Panama Canal. Obviously, this treaty faced severe criticism and protests from Panamanians. For the first two years of the US attempt, they face many of the same challenges as the French. After these years, the Americans changed their plan and implemented a lock design. This design change allowed for a much easier construction and led for the canal to be possible. Nevertheless, highly skilled workers from America was hard to keep in Panama due to low pay and ruthless conditions, so Theodore Roosevelt sent the army to fulfill higher skilled jobs. The majority of the labor force building the canal was actually from Barbados. They were giving the worst working conditions and a strict apartheid system was put into place. The project was finished by 1913 and opened on August 15, 1914 (Parker, 2014). The canal stayed in full US control until 1974. After World War II tensions between the US and Panama increased and there were many protests regarding the canals rightful owner. The sentiments of Panamanians were ignored and quenched for a decade, until 1974 when negotiations started. On September 7, 1977, the  Torrijos–Carter Treaties were signed, which gave Panama free control of the canal only if they controlled the canal neutrally. The treaty also abolished all previous agreements between the two countries. After 20 years the treaty would expire and the canal would be given to Panama to have full control. Thus on December 31, 1999, the canal was fully given to Panama (Tenner, 2005).
The Canal has had a profound impact on the economy of Panama. 80% of Panama’s GDP is made up from the service industry. The Canal is responsible for almost 40% of the GDP alone. The Canal only makes 2.8% of the GDP in revenue, but it is the reason many of Panama’s service sector is able to exist. Meaning if the canal was not there half of the country's service sector would not be able to function. Panama has always had a relatively strong economy. Starting with the Spanish, they used the isthmus as a major port to transport gold from Peru to Spain. Since the economy of Panama has mostly always been trade, the native populations never had a reason to diversify and/or change agricultural and social behavior (Meditz, 1987). This stagnation of evolution is mostly due to the fact that the people reaping the benefits of the isthmus have been foreigners until the modern era. While native populations did feel the benefits of the trade, they were not the direct beneficiaries. This led to an extremely centralized economy until the 20th century. Their economy has been primarily based on trade and only recently has been diversified. Due to the centralized economy, Panama has historically been harshly subjected to the natural rhythm of trade fluctuations. As gold exports declined in the 18th century due to the Spanish empire having financial difficulties, the isthmus saw a drastic decrease in trade. In the mid 19th century trade throughout the region saw a growth again due to the California Gold Rush. Gold trade flourished and eventually lead to the US investment into building the railroad across Panama. The railroad saw, even more, trade flow through Panama and growth prolonged for another 15 years until the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in America (Meditz, 1987). One of the major influences on the canal has been the US economy status. With the California Gold Rush boosting the economy of America, we see the exact same boom in Panama. This connection led to the investment in the construction of the canal, which helped to diversify the economy. At this time, many migrant workers came to Panama and the economy had to grow in order to meet the needs of all the people. Here is where Panama’s strong service sector developed. As the economy grew the government of Panama decided to adopt the US dollar (Savastano, 1996). The dollar brought a stable currency. This move by Panama was ingenious since it helped to increase investors trust in the country and thus led to much more foreign investment. Many argue that this was an act by the Americans to implement a puppet state, but nevertheless, the adoption of the dollar led to even closer ties to the US economy (Savastano, 1996). As the canal finished construction, Panama City and Colon experienced unprecedented growth and till this day is the biggest cities in Panama. With the rapid migration to urban centers, infrastructure developed without much planning, which is leading to problems in the modern day. Little thought was provided to environmental impacts and growth capabilities. Today many political decisions of the country are centered around infrastructure improvements. Back in the 1930’s the worldwide economic depression led to a loss of trade. This made many of the workers in the cities unemployed and led to a wave of peasants out of the cities and into the countryside to practice subsistence farming (Meditz, 1987). WWII came and led to massive growth due to US navy investing money to keep the canal safe and using the canal as a transit point. But alongside the war, the post-war depression again led to more unregulated subsistence farming due to an increase in unemployment. Unlike the last depression, the Panamanian government decided to step in and create regulations to stabilize the country's economy. Agriculture regulations were put into place. Government spending on public works increased to raise employment. Many other regulations were passed, most modeled after US economic policy (Meditz, 1987). As the economy of the world experienced great growth from 1950-1970, Panama reaped the benefits. Trade increased substantially and lead to an annual average GDP growth rate of 6.4%. This is astoundingly high and among the highest prolonged growth periods in any country. This growth rate encouraged people to move back into cities. Diversified agriculture developed since there was less competition. Regulations also helped increase crop variety and fostered sustainable planting. Banking and tourism sectors developed due to increased Canal activity. A major hit to Panama’s growth was the Oil crisis in the 1970s. Trade decreased and Panama suffered. GDP growth stagnated close to 1% and even dipped negative in 1984 with a rate of -0.4% (Meditz, 1987). Due to this Panama had to borrow from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). By the middle of the 80’s Panama owed ~$360 million to the IMF (Boughton, 2001). The president at the time, Manuel Noriega, was accused by the US and Germany of establishing a narco-state and the IMF concluded in a resolution the country was not allowed to borrow any more. Eventually, the US invasion of Panama dethroned Noriega. By the 1990s Panama had been allowed to borrow from the IMF, and Panama sought to liberalize trade policies (Boughton, 2001). They joined the World Trade Organization and reformed the banking sector. This led again to growth hovering around 3-5% annually until the modern day. 
From this look at the history of the Panamanian economy, it is obvious that the economy is heavily tied to trade and particularly the US economy. With the expansion of the Panama canal ending in 2016 the long-term effects on the economy are unknown. The Panama Canal Expansion project was a huge undertaking by the country of Panama. The project resulted in a whole new traffic lane through the canal. It also increased the depth and width of the existing canal to accommodate vessels almost 1.5 times the width of previous ships. These so called Post-Panamax ships are set to increase the capacity of the goods going through the canal by 2 times. Panama’s president, at the time, said that this expansion project will transform Panama into a first world country. While the benefits are clear to the expansion, the project was not cheap. With a cost of $5.25 billion, it is fair to say that the government invested an enormous amount of capital into the project, nearly a fourth of their GDP (Zamorano, 2018). To predict whether this investment has a promising outlook, we have to examine the factors that impacted the original canals economic success. The first of those factors being the US economy. With the American economy doing very strong and not projected to crash the outlook for Panama’s economy looks hopeful. But as oil prices rising year after year, shipping is becoming more and more expensive. While boats are still the most fuel-efficient vehicles and the cheapest, many theorists believe that economy will slow down growth rates in the distant future. The necessity for consumers to have goods transported instantaneously has actually already hurt the Canals profits (Martinez, 2016). Air freighters are experiencing huge amounts of growth as internet shopping revolutionizes consumer good consumption. Luckily for the expansion project the rise of Chinese manufacturing had made the canal an important waterway. The east coast of America and parts of Europe are relying on the canal to receive shipments from Asian manufacturers (Martinez, 2016). Currently, many Pro-US regulations are in place for the canal. With the US economy moving away from production, and the Chinese heavily investing in manufacturing, Panama may need to implement new policies to cater to the growing Chinese shipping companies (Muirhead, 2015). As the US and China are the biggest trade partners in the world, the foreign policy of the two nations greatly affects Panama. With the recent trade war occurring between the two nations, and tensions growing, Panama may suffer from the loss of trade. Nevertheless, Panama is projected to achieve all time high GDP growth rates. The expansion of the Panama Canal is also projected to bring in $2 billion annually, which is a huge increase over previous canal profits (Zamorano, 2018). Luckily for the project, they took loans in 2008, meaning that when the 2011 recession hit, the true value of the loans decreased. Also, 2011 was the peak of the project's construction, meaning the workers' wages were reduced. All this means that the canal should be able to pay off all debts within 8 years (Zamorano, 2018). This is extremely important since the canal will be able to generate meaningful profit in a relatively small amount of time. By analyzing the main factors that contributed to the success of the original Panama Canal, it is evident that the expansion project should be at a minimum profitable and most likely help Panama elevate it’s economic situation.
One of the greatest impacts of the canal has been on the environment of Panama. The canal runs through the Chagres River Basin and has two artificially created lakes. The first lake, named Gatun Lake, was created in 1913 when the Chagres river was closed off from the Atlantic. The second lake was Alhajuela Lake, created in 1934, was made by a dam in the Madden river. Specifically, Alhajuela Lake has had a big impact (De Marucci, 2012). It serves as the water source for Panama city and it serves to hydrate the protected forests surrounding the basin (Moreno, 1993). While there are protected forests, deforestation is by far the biggest environmental impact of the Panama Canal. The canal’s construction was not the reason for the loss of trees, but the rapid and unregulated growth around the canal is responsible. In 1952, 85% of the basin was forested, but by 1983 the percentage dropped to 30% (Moreno, 1993). The deforestation around the basin is mostly caused by the need to sustain a much bigger population. The Chagres River basin had to support approximately 1500 people during the colonial period (Moreno, 1993). In 1990 the basin had to support 113,000 people (Ibanez, 2002). With Panama City being the main home of all these people, the growth of the city was unregulated, leading to deforestation and pollution (Moreno, 1993). Also, much of the population growth was due to migrant workers moving to Panama. These workers were not wealthy and caused a large peasant population to grow. To live these peasants had to move up into the forested parts of Panama. Here many groups started farming crops to make money. Agriculture needs space so deforestation started. Also since the crops were unregulated, disease run rampant through the crops devastating fields, causing people to move and create new fields. Cattle grazing and the prominent practice of slash and burn helped to accelerate deforestation (Moreno, 1993). Furthermore, infrastructure developments caused deforestation. The need for roads to connect rural populations and urban centers helped carve the forests and make them thinner and thinner (Espinosa, 1997). 
With the expansion project of the Panama canal, the environmental impact needs to be evaluated. From the impact of the initial canal construction, it is easy to predict the impact of the expansion project. The expansion project required an enormous excavation and depletion of vegetation. Because of this, the risk of landslides is severely increased (Brakenwagen, 2015). The risk prior to the expansion project was already very high and with the expansion project increasing that risk serious amounts of monitoring of seismic activity needs to occur.  Also with the depletion of the vegetation around the surrounding areas, erosion of ground soil will be another major threat to Panama. With this increase in erosion, water quality will decrease and the air quality will decrease. Other factors that will decrease the water quality is dredging. The expansion project will dredge parts of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans causing turbulent waters to suspend soil in the water (Schneider, 2015). Also dredging in the Miraflores lakes will alter the volume and area of the lakes (Brakenwagen, 2015). This decrease in water quality will be felt mainly by coastal marine life. It will make it harder for those animals and plants to survive. The air quality will also substantially decrease, not only due to the emissions of the construction equipment, but long-term air quality reductions will occur due to the higher amounts of ships and larger vessels going through the canal (Schneider, 2015). The reduction in water quality and air quality will most likely be the biggest long-term impact of the expansion project and is a factor that needs to be addressed by the Port Authority. One of the major positive impacts of the canal expansion project will be better control of the watershed surrounding the canal. We can see when the original canal was built, it allowed for the creation of lakes that helped stabilize the water supply into Panama City. As the city grows, more water will be needed and with the expansion project looking into controlling even more waterways and lakes, the stability of major Panamanian cities water supplies will be an increase (Brakenwagen, 2015). A smaller environmental impact of the expansion project will be a global change. When the original canal was constructed many ports along America’s coasts and other countries had to be overhauled to increase capacity and be able to support ships passing through the canal (Bhadury, 2015). With the expansion project, these ports are going to need to be overhauled again. Key ports like Miami, Mobile, Long Beach, and Seattle are going through massive expansions totaling over $12 Billion (Bhadury, 2016). These port expansions will cause reductions in water and air quality in their respective cities, which is a direct impact of the Panama Canal Expansion Project. 
Panama has been a trade hub since the early eras of history. With the completion of the first Panama Canal, Panama has transformed from a trade hub to one of the most influential countries in trade. As Panama finishes the Expansion Project, the economic and environmental impact of the project can only be estimated by looking back on the initial construction of the canal. It is imperative that we predict these impacts so that we are able to adapt and ensure a sustainable economy and environment.
